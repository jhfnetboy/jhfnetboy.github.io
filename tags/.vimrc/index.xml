      <description>spf13-vim, a completely cross platform distribution of vim plugins and resources for Vim, GVim and MacVim stays true to it&amp;rsquo;s vim roots while adding modern features including a plugin management system, a curated plugin set with customized configuration, advanced autocomplete, tags, support for dozens of languages and much more.
I recently read a thread where the author asked for feedback on whether or not to use spf13-vim. Responses varied greatly with some people loving it to others claiming it was bloated and overkill.</description>

      <description>This post is a bit behind the actual releases, but should be announced here nevertheless. Announcing the 3rd major release of spf13-vim. spf13-vim is a distribution of vim plugins and resources for Vim, GVim and MacVim. It is a completely cross platform distribution that stays true to the feel of vim while providing modern features like a plugin management system, autocomplete, tags and tons more. It grew out of my vim configuration which I put on GitHub.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/media/vim_logo.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;vim&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  I have spent the last few years tweaking and refining my VIM configuration. This is the ultimate VIM configuration .vimrc file. It is well organized and documented. It is on GitHub so you can always grab the latest. It works well alone, but is intended to be paired with the plugins and configuration found in my complete .vim configuration also hosted on GitHub.
