      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/media/3832960068_1f7a654ee9_b.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;NYC&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  As part of my new years resolution to get in shape and spend less dough I decided that Iâ€™d be better of walking from Grand Central to my office on 18th St. I save ~$5 a day not taking the subway and get all the extra benefit of walking the 1.5 miles.
A few days into this something wonderful and unexpected happened. Instead of spending 20 minutes riding in a cattle car, I was able to take 25 minutes where I was able to think about everything I had to do for the day.</description>
