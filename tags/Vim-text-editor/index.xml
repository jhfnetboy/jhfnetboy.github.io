      <description>spf13-vim, a completely cross platform distribution of vim plugins and resources for Vim, GVim and MacVim stays true to it&amp;rsquo;s vim roots while adding modern features including a plugin management system, a curated plugin set with customized configuration, advanced autocomplete, tags, support for dozens of languages and much more.
I recently read a thread where the author asked for feedback on whether or not to use spf13-vim. Responses varied greatly with some people loving it to others claiming it was bloated and overkill.</description>

      <description>This post is a bit behind the actual releases, but should be announced here nevertheless. Announcing the 3rd major release of spf13-vim. spf13-vim is a distribution of vim plugins and resources for Vim, GVim and MacVim. It is a completely cross platform distribution that stays true to the feel of vim while providing modern features like a plugin management system, autocomplete, tags and tons more. It grew out of my vim configuration which I put on GitHub.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/media/vim_logo.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;vim&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  I have spent the last few years tweaking and refining my VIM configuration until I had the Ultimate Vim Config. It is well organized and documented taking full advantage of Tpope’s pathogen for a excellent clean and modular configuration. The Ultimate vim config contains the perfect .vimrc file combined with an excellent set of plugins all easily managed thanks to pathogen and git. It is on GitHub so you can always grab the latest.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/media/vim_logo.png&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  Most developers know the basics of VIM, enough to edit a conf file, but most stay there, unaware of the power and beauty of vim. One of my developers has expressed desire to abandon the bloated GUI ways of eclipse and discover VIM. I have been using VIM for such a long time I forgot how difficult that transition is. Here are some resources and approaches to help you learn vim.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/media/vim_logo.png&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  Why use it  It’s super easy to use It has tons of snippets It’s pretty well compatible with TextMate snippets for easy portability Dynamic variables, for all the times you use the same string multiple times It’s really easy to define your own snippets It’s better than anything else out there, trust me I’ve tried them all  Sometimes a video works better to explain things.</description>

      <title>Vim Plugins: NERD Commenter</title>
      <link>http://localhost:888/post/vim-plugins-nerd-commenter/</link>

      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/media/vim_logo.png&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  The NERD Commenter is an indispensable tool when programming in VIM. It understands like a zillion different file types and properly comments each. It can handle single line, multi line, partial line commenting as well as nesting. If you’re programming in VIM you really should be using it.
It is simple enough to use. Most commands are mapped to ,c[character]. The command you are probably going to use the most is ,c&amp;lt;space&amp;gt; which intelligently toggles a comment on or off.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/media/vim_logo.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;vim&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  One of the things that makes vim great is that it can be extended through plugins. There are plugins for more than you would expect. I have gathered together the 15 best plugins. I’ve included these plugins as part of my ultimate VIM configuration which has been featured on many sites and is hosted on github. I’ve also begun a series of posts on some of these plugins including snipmate and NerdCommenter.</description>
