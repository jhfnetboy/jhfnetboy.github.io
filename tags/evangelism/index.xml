      <description>I recently had a discussion with a CFO of a technology company. We were meeting because he is trying to better understand the role technical evangelism could play within his company. Ten minutes into our conversation he said, &amp;ldquo;so evangelism is pretty much rogue sales&amp;rdquo;. Internally I cringed. I politely corrected him that the two could not be further apart.
Allow me to be a bit philosophical or rather, etymological here.</description>
