      <description>Today I visited one of the largest national office supply outlets. I had a specific purpose in mind. I needed to pickup 2 wireless routers and 1 audio cable. What transpired caused me to wonder why anyone does any offline shopping anymore.
My experience at the store caused me to reflect on the many things we simply put up with at the store which we would never permit online.
To begin with I had to drive to the store.</description>
