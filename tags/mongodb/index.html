    I’m pleased to announce the coordinated release of drivers in 9 languages in preparation for the release of MongoDB 2.6. This is the largest driver release in the history of MongoDB, both in terms of code changes as well as in terms of drivers released. Official Drivers for C, C++, C# (.net), Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby and Scala were all released with Perl following shortly. In the upcoming weeks community drivers will be updated to take advantage of the new features present in MongoDB 2.

    I gave this presentation to a packed house at DevCon5 in NYC July 24th. DevCon5 is a web developers conference and this year it focused on HTML5. This was one of the hardest presentations I&rsquo;ve worked on for the simple fact that the audience had name recognition, but not familiarity with the database industry. Typically I&rsquo;ve leaned on the fact that most participants were familiar with at least one database prior to my presentation, I had no such luxury here.

    This is a 90 minute MongoDB tutorial on using MongoDB in PHP which I gave as a webcast for O&rsquo;Reilly last year.. The tutorial covers everything from Installing MongoDB along with installing and configuring the MongoDB PHP driver. You will learn how to work with MongoDB from within PHP as well as within the MongoDB shell.
What would happen if you optimized a data store for the operations application developers to actually use?

    Two times a year the drivers team at 10gen gathers together for a face to face meeting to spend time together working on issues and setting forth our goals for the upcoming six months. In September 2012 we all converged on New York City for the second ever driver days. This time we split up into teams for a hack-a-thon. As maintainers of drivers &amp; integrations in over a dozen different languages while we are on the same team, it isn’t often that we actually work together on the same codebase.

Over 150 people were in the audience, a pretty significant number of this type of hands on tutorial. Certainly worth the weeks of preparation that went into developing it. While at OSCON I put the slides online at SlideShare where during the four day conference the amassed over 20k views and within a couple weeks over 30k views.

    &lt;img src=&quot;/media/MongoDB-at-oscon-2012.png&quot; /&gt;  This is a 3 hour tutorial I wrote for and gave at OSCON 2012.
Here is the summary:
This tutorial will introduce the features of MongoDB by building a simple location-based application using MongoDB. The tutorial will cover the basics of MongoDB’s document model, query language, map-reduce framework and deployment architecture.
The tutorial will be divided into 5 sections:
 Data modeling with MongoDB: documents, collections and databases Querying your data: simple queries, geospatial queries, and text-searching Writes and updates: using MongoDB’s atomic update modifiers Trending and analytics: Using mapreduce and MongoDB’s aggregation framework Deploying the sample application  Besides the knowledge to start building their own applications with MongoDB, attendees will finish the session with a working application they use to check into locations around Portland from any HTML5 enabled phone!

    Nearly 3 years ago I discovered a new database that literally changed my life. I know, that’s a pretty bold claim, but it’s true. While leading the engineering team at OpenSky I faced a problem I was well familiar with. How to build a e-commerce product that: 1. Provided performance and scale 2. Handled many verticals and 3. Provided proper indexing on key attributes. In search for a better solution to this problem I encountered MongoDB.

    Learn how to integrate MongoDB with Hadoop for large-scale distributed data processing. Using Hadoop’s MapReduce and Streaming you will learn how to do analytics and ETL on large datasets with the ability to load and save data against MongoDB. With support for Hadoop streaming support goes beyond the native Java enabling map reduce to be run in languages like Python and Ruby.

    Learn how to integrate MongoDB with Hadoop for large-scale distributed data processing. Using tools like MapReduce, Pig and Streaming you will learn how to do analytics and ETL on large datasets with the ability to load and save data against MongoDB. With Hadoop MapReduce, Java and Scala programmers will find a native solution for using MapReduce to process their data with MongoDB. Programmers of all kinds will find a new way to work with ETL using Pig to extract and analyze large datasets and persist the results to MongoDB.

    After an enjoyable time at the SORT conference in 2011 I was invited to come back to SLC to present at the RootsTech Genealogy conference.
The two hardest data types to model are e-commerce and genealogy. There really just isn’t any good way to do it in a relational database. MongoDB is the answer Genealogy developers have been looking for for a very long time. A flexible schema that allows adhoc searching, horizontal scale and full data integrity.

    &lt;img src=&quot;/media/disaster_day_of_crisis.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;crisis&quot; /&gt;  One of the most common concerns people have is how to ensure that their application is safe, secure and available in the event of an emergency. Often I have found that people are mistakenly believe that they are protected when in fact they often have ignored potential scenarios.
The principles explained apply equally well in RDBMSs, MongoDB and other databases.
Potential scenarios to protect against   Drive failure   Machine failure   Switch failure   Power circuit failure   Data center failure   Intrusion   Fat fingers   Programmer error   Raid To prevent drive failure use multiple drives in a single machine for high availability.

    MongoDB is often used alongside a relational database such as Oracle or MySQL. It is often unclear when one should use one or the other, or if a combination is really ideal. During this online presentation, we will discuss the ideal use cases for each, and how they can be used in conjunction. We’ll make sure to touch on several real world examples.

    10gen had our flagship conference in Silicon Valley. I gave an introductory presentation at the first session on building an application in MongoDB. This talk will introduce the features of MongoDB by walking through how one can building a simple location-based application using MongoDB. It covers the basics of MongoDB’s document model, query language, map-reduce framework and deployment architecture.

    I had the opportunity to present at the PHP Cloud Summit 2011 among some great presenters. This was first time speaking at an online conference. Thanks to the diligent efforts from Cal, Keith and Jeremy at PHPArch it was a really successful experience. I actually presented with two Macbooks. One open to IRC where questions were coming in and the other open to the presentation. In spite of it being all online, the audience asked some great questions and it was really fun to interact with them.

    &lt;img src=&quot;/media/sort-win.png&quot; alt=&quot;sort conference&quot; /&gt;  Last week I had the opportunity to attend the LDS Church’s SORT tech conference. Nearly 1200 people were in attendance. There were 23 concurrent tracks and I was able to present two presentations and be on a panel with other NoSQL solutions including Cassandra, CouchDB, Neo4j, Riak and MarkLogic. The panel went for 90 minutes the first half being an 5 – 10 minute introduction of each technology and the second half being a QA period.

    This presentation was given at the LDS Tech SORT Conference 2011 in Salt Lake City. The slides are quite comprehensive covering many topics on MongoDB. Rather than a traditional presentation, this was presented as more of a Q &amp; A session. Topics covered include. Introduction to MongoDB, Use Cases, Schema design, High availability (replication) and Horizontal Scaling (sharding).

    Last week I had the pleasure of attending MongoUK in London. I had a great time presenting and meeting new friends. I even survived two whiteboard sessions where people were invited to ask any question, any at all, about MongoDB.
I gave a pretty significatly revised presentation on MongoDB and E-Commerce with emphasis on transactions. If you saw the presentation at MongoNYC this summer, it’s worth a revisit.

    &lt;img src=&quot;/media/mongodb-sq.png&quot; alt=&quot;mongodb&quot; /&gt;  Perhaps you’ll recognize these words, “About five years ago I started to notice an odd thing. The products that the database vendors were building had less and less to do with what the customers wanted. … So, what is this growing disconnect?” Those words were written in 2004 by Adam Bosworth, a veteren of Microsoft, Google and BEA. In the 7 years since things have only gotten worse.

This presentation is really the sequel (no pun intended) to my presentation, MongoDB &amp; Ecommerce : A Perfect Combination. This presentation takes you through how we created a hybrid solution blending both sql and nosql to achieve an optimal solution.

    Last night I gave a presentation on MongoDB &amp; Ecommerce. OpenSky is the first company to use MongoDB in production for ecommerce. I shared why we went this route, and why it’s an obvious and powerful combination. At OpenSky we use MongoDB to develop the next ecommerce platform. OpenSky also uses Symfony 2, Doctrine 2, PHP 5.3, PHPUnit 3.5, jQuery, node.js, Git (with gitflow) and a touch of Java and Python.
