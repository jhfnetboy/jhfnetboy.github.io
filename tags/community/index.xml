      <description>Hugo, the fast and flexible static site generator, is really coming of age. I wanted to give a quick update about the progress Hugo has been making over the past couple months.
New Website Hugo can now be found at http://gohugo.io. Update your bookmarks.
New Team Members I want to formally welcome our newest team members.
