      <title>A Better Follow Friday</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/media/twitter-following.jpg&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  Follow Friday is a common practice on Twitter where many people spend friday posting things like #FF @aplusk @guykawasaki … This practice is distracting at best and fails to accomplish the single purpose it intends. Follow friday began as way to share lesser known twitter users with your community. A great idea that quickly grew out of control. I propose a better implementation that will not only accomplish the original intent but will do so in a non-distrcting manner by leveraging twitter lists.</description>
