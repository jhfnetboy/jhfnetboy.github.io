<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At OSCON 2012 in Portland I gave a presentation on <a href="http://spf13.com/presentation/building-your-first-mongodb-app-oscon-2012" title="Building your first MongoDB app – OSCON 2012">building your first
MongoDB
application</a>.
Over 150 people were in the audience, a pretty significant number of
this type of hands on tutorial. Certainly worth the weeks of preparation
that went into developing it. While at OSCON I put the slides online at
SlideShare where during the four day conference the amassed over 20k
views and within a couple weeks over 30k views. Within a month it had
been viewed more than ten times the total attendees at OSCON, one of the
largest technical conferences in the world.</p>
<p>How was this presentation so successful that it amassed more views in
it’s first week than any other presentation had accumulated over 12
years? Here are the four critical things I did to generate such an
amazingly high number of views.</p>
<h1 id="have-an-interesting--unique-topic">Have an interesting &amp; unique topic</h1>
<p>The first two items are focused on the preparation. Your topic needs to
be something that people are both interested in and find interesting. To
be both it should be unique about something popular. I’m really
passionate about building great things and so are a lot of people. Like
many people out there I’ve looked into using new technologies to make
the process of building applications easier and more enjoyable. This
behavior led me to explore NoSQL solutions which led me to
<a href="http://MongoDB.org">MongoDB</a>. MongoDB is one of the most popular
technologies right now. It’s claiming a significant lead over other
NoSQL technologies and catching quickly to the leaders in the very
established relational space. Remember I’m commenting here on popularity
and interest. This is easily discoverable by looking at things like
google trends or frequency of mentions on niche sites like hacker news.
With popularity comes noise. To stand out from the noise you need a
unique topic or take on it. In giving this presentation I chose to focus
on ‘writing your first ruby application backed by MongoDB’. From
skeleton to deployment. To my knowledge this hadn’t been done before and
was something that stood out to people.</p>
<h1 id="make-it-broad-and-approachable">Make it broad and approachable</h1>
<p>To reach the largest group of people you need to appeal to a large group
of people. This means giving a presentation that is approachable that
many different kinds of interested people could follow along and find
value in. Given that this presentation was aimed at first time MongoDB
users without much development experience it really resonated with a lot
of people. One nice thing about OSCON is that it attracts a really
diverse crowd. If  it was appropriate for the audience there, it would
work well for the broader Internet audience which OSCON is
a microcosm of.</p>
<h1 id="cater-to-the-online-audience">Cater to the online audience</h1>
<p>Whenever I create my slide decks I’m always focused on two audiences.
The live audience that will see the presentation projected onto a screen
and the remote audience that will be viewing it on slideshare via their
computers/laptops/tablets etc. Most people ignore that second group, but
a good presentation will always reach more people online than in person.
If anything it’s the group that can’t afford to be ignored. I ensure
that the slides flow well even without my narration. I give them to a
few friends without the accompanying talking and see how well they can
follow them. I make sure to use good layouts that use the space well and
are readable when on the projector from the back of the room as well as
when embedded on a web page. It’s important when using slideshare and
the other sites that you review the presentation on them as well as
embedded as conversion is sometimes destructive, especially if you are
using a unsupported font.</p>
<h1 id="give-it-a-good-start">Give it a good start</h1>
<p>Success begets success. During the live presentation I put the slides up
on slideshare so that the attendees could follow along at their own
pace. Since the audience was largely working with the code in the
presentation it made a lot of sense for them to bring it up on their
laptops. With the 150+ audience members all viewing the presentation
that gave it a very big initial push. A few of them also tweeted it
which helped even more people to view and follow it. Slideshare has a
ranking algorithm that tracks when a lot of people view a presentation
in a short amount of time and flag it as a “hot” presentation. Within a
couple of hours it had 600+ views and a couple dozen tweets on twitter.</p>
<p>That evening I got an email from slide share that my presentation was
getting a lot of views. I got a second email that it was experiencing a
high volume of tweets as well. It continued to climb up the ranks. The
next morning it was selected as the SlideShare presentation of the day.</p>
<pre><code>@slideshare: '#OSCON 2012 MongoDB Tutorial' by @spf13 is a #SlideShare presentation of the day http://t.co/74DqqsJR cc @oscon on Twitter http://twitter.com/slideshare/status/225393208581038080&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>On Tuesday it had amassed an outstanding 7k+ views</p>
<p>From there it became a presentation of the week. It was featured
prominently on the home page where it remained for the next 3 days at
which point over 22k people had viewed it.</p>
<p>Once it fell off the home page and popular/week lists and tweets became
less regular the number of views were still significant, but had slowed
to a few hundred a day. At the time of this writing it’s over 30k views
and climbing.</p>
